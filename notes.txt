CategoryController.cs is where I talk to the database   ... CRUD operations

Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml = This is where the navigation bar is, and where I need to change the Links
	This is also where I put links to bootstrap or other imports that I want ... fontawesome

appsettings.json is where I configure the default connection string

Startup.cs also needs some configuration in order to connect to the database

*** View passes data entered in to the model, which then passes the object to the controller

Data folder/ApplicationDbContext.cs = SUPER IMPORTANT for creating data objects for the database
	After creating a database object ... run the package manager code to create the migration
	Then run more code to update-database

Server side validation = CategoryController.cs ... check code

Client side validation ... This one seems better and faster ... check code for the view on Create.cshtml

When creating the Edit and Delete actions in CategoryController... I did not change much
